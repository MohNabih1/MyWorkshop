""" The output.txt file includes the all the outputs that were generated in the terminal 
    after running the code on all 3 data sets using either KNN or SVM
    Since it was not very clear in the assignment description for TASK2 what 
    specifically the output.txt file should contain (As in, what method? And what dataset?) 
    I decided to include the output of running the code on all 3 data sets using either 
    KNN or SVM."""
